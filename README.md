This is a blog made for educational purposes during my React-course at Chas Academy.

These were the criterias:

- Multifaceted application using navigation - The app should consist of at least two main pages, in the navigation menu the logged in user should be visible.

- Blogposts - Blogposts written by someone else but the user stored in an array consisting of title, bodytext and author. A list of blogposts should be visible at the page. Users shouyld be able to add blogposts, and edit or delete their own blogposts.

* Comments - There should be the possibility to add cmments to posts, these should have a bodytext and author.
  Comments should be visible under each post that has comments.

* Global states - useContext should be used for storing posts and comments.

* Categories - When creating/editing a post the user should be able to choose categories. The posts in the landing-page should be categorised and the user should be able to choose between what categories to show.
