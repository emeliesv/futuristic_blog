This is a blog made for educational purposes during my React-course at Chas Academy.

These were the criterias:

- Multifaceted application using navigation - The app should consist of at least two main pages, in the navigation menu the logged in user should be visible.

- Blogposts - Blogposts written by someone else but the user stored in an array consisting of title, bodytext and author. A list of blogposts should be visible at the page. Users shouyld be able to add blogposts, and edit or delete their own blogposts.
